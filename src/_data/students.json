        "It started about one year ago. I was trying to improve myself to get out of the jobs that where not improving me. I started to do some tutorials on codecademy, but it was not that serious. Then I saw a live coding show of CodeTap on Facebook that got my attention. I have hesitated a looooong time to contact Marian (I am a bit shy), but after that I took coding in a more serious manner.",
        "I have created small simple webpages, learned and still learning how PUG Starter works; how to deal with errors etc. I've also learned some coding sintax, that is very important in web build; to refractor the code so I will not repeat myself... and many other things still to come to my knowledge.",
        "In the last few years I have realised that coding is the \"new\" thing. The reason I have started coding  is that I want to have some income, not a high one. I also want to have the independence to work form any part of the world and not form a 9  to 5 in an office."
