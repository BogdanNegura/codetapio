        "After 2 years of maritime navigation around Europe, one day, I've decided I need a career change. That's when CodeTap showed up on my Facebook page. Ever since day 0, I was able to build and to understand how websites work, even though I had no knowledge before I started. Managed to get my first job on the first interview I had, after only 1 month and 17 days of hardcore coding for a minimum of 6 hours per day. So, I'm challenging you to break my record ! ðŸ˜€"

Marian helped me understand the process, thought me about each and every programming language or programs are needed in order to build a website. The most important thing I learned was the mind set while learning and working at the same time, as I had to find a logic behind the code. Any goal can be accomplished if you put enough effort into it!"

Marian has been a great teacher and kept in focus always the most important lessons to build a robust knowledge tree in a fast and efficient way. You will find him picking you up from the corn fields as soon as you drift away from what's important. Another very important aspect is that coding with CodeTap has equipped me with tricks only acquired trough over 20 years of hard work and best practice coding (you'll soon know what 'best practice' means) and experience that Marian has managed to compress into proper and easily digestible gems. This has launched me far ahead of my competition. Once my resume website was finished, Marian narrowed down the essentials of how to deal with an interview and build confidence by preparing ahead. Also making sure I was visible to employers on all major job platforms. Once launched on the job market my phone didn't stop ringing. Even today I'm still being called at least 5 times a day and all my job platforms accounts are shut.",
